          <h2 class="h3">CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h2>
          <p class="text-muted">
            The Company is strongly committed to protecting the safety and
            privacy of children who use the Services. We do not knowingly
            collect personal information online from children under 16 without
            consent from the Authorized Person. The Company acknowledges and
            agrees that when administered in a school setting, the school's
            ability to consent for the parent is limited to the educational
            context – where an operator collects personal information from
            children for the use and benefit of the school, and for no other
            commercial purpose. The Company does not use personally identifiable
            information for any other commercial purpose. When provided by an
            Authorized Person, we may receive some or all of the personally
            identifiable information which the parent, guardian, or Authorized
            Person has voluntarily submitted. Any information submitted by
            children and adults, whether it would be considered personally
            identifiable information or not, is treated by the Company with the
            same safeguards as personally identifiable information. An
            Authorized Person who has given the Company permission to collect
            and use a child's personal information can modify, update, correct a
            child's information, or discontinue further collection or use of a
            child's information.
